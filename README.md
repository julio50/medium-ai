re# medium-ai: An open-source AI-powered text editor

This is an AI-powered text editor whose design is inspired by [medium](https://medium.com). If you're already familiar with [medium](https://medium.com), you'll feel right at home.

**Note:** medium-ai is an independent project and is not affliated with medium.com in any way. 

Apart from the regular features that rich text editors have, medium-ai supports the following AI features:

### AI Autosuggesion

As soon as you start typing into the editor, the article context is taken and passed onto the LLM which predicts any possible ideas that might be written. If you don't like the current suggestion, press `ctrl + space` to generate a new one. Moreover, you can select different models from the top right corner of the menu to experiment with different suggestions.

### AI Edit

To edit text, select it and enter the desired instruction in the toolbar's text field. The editor will then automatically execute the instruction and update the selected text with the result.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wingedrasengan927/medium-ai
```

2. Access the project directory.

```shell
cd medium-ai
```

### Frontend Installation

1. Access the frontend directory
   
   ```shell
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies.
   
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```

3. Start dev server with hot reload atÂ [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).
   
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend installation

The frontend will run in itself, however if you would want to save the data and access AI features, the backend must be running.

Before running the backend, you need to create an openai API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Follow the below steps next:

1. Copy the key, create a file called `.env` inside the `backend/app/config` folder, and paste the API key like so:
   
   ```shell
   OPENAI_KEY=si-IAx6f6cWlgqJ69RVwFKxT3BlbkFJI15IMe23MVM6GVLgjuSD
   
   ```
   
   ```
   Folder Structure:
   
   - medium-ai
   -- frontend
   -- backend
   --- app
   ---- config
   ----- .env
   ```

2. Next, it's preferable to install an anaconda virtual environment. You can install the anaconda distribution from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/). After installation, you can create a new virtual environment and activate it using the following command:
   
   ```
   conda create -n medium-ai python==3.9 anaconda
   conda activate medium-ai
   ```

3. Next, you need to access the `backend` folder and install the requirements using the following command:
   
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Make sure you're inside the `backend` directory and run the following command to start the server running on port `8080`.
   
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5. Finally, refresh the browser and the frontend will automatically pick up the saved data (if any) stored at `backend/app/data/editor_state.json`

### Docker Installation

1.  Make sure you have Docker installed. You can download it from [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2.  Navigate to the root of the project directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
3.  Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key, base URL, and model like so:

    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
    OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-3.5-turbo
    ```

4.  Run the following command to build and start the application:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

5.  The frontend will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/) and the backend at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080/).

## End Notes

If you're looking for a template-free, open-source, AI-powered text editor, medium-ai is the right choice.

However, it is still in its early days and has some unnoticed bugs. I will keep on improving it with time. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please raise an issue. Also, if you want to contribute to the project, please check out the GitHub repository.

**Note**: It's important to take backup of your articles frequently and store it elsewhere just in case something goes wrong.

## Acknowledgements

1. medium-ai is built using [Lexical](https://lexical.dev) - a text editor framework developed by Meta. Most of the plugins are taken from the [lexical playground](https://playground.lexical.dev/) and have been modified slightly.
2. [DaisyUI](https://daisyui.com/) has been used to create most of the UI components.

Thanks to lexical core members and the amazing community for all the help.
