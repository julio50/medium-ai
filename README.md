# medium-ai: An open-source AI-powered text editor

This is an AI-powered text editor whose design is inspired by [medium](https://medium.com). If you're already familiar with [medium](https://medium.com), you'll feel right at home.

**Note:** medium-ai is an independent project and is not affliated with medium.com in any way. 

Apart from the regular features that rich text editors have, medium-ai supports the following AI features:

### AI Autosuggesion

As soon as you start typing into the editor, the article context is taken and passed onto the LLM which predicts any possible ideas that might be written. If you don't like the current suggestion, press `ctrl + space` to generate a new one. Moreover, you can select different models from the top right corner of the menu to experiment with different suggestions.

### AI Edit

To edit text, select it and enter the desired instruction in the toolbar's text field. The editor will then automatically execute the instruction and update the selected text with the result.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/wingedrasengan927/medium-ai
```

2. Access the project directory.

```shell
cd medium-ai
```

### Frontend Installation

1. Access the frontend directory
   
   ```shell
   cd frontend
   ```
   
   
   

2. Install dependencies.
   
   ```shell
   npm install
   ```
   
   

3. Start dev server with hot reload atÂ [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173/).
   
   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

### Backend installation

The frontend will run in itself, however if you would want to save data and access AI features, the backend must be running.

Before running the backend, you need to create an openai API key from [here]([OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys)).

1. Copy the key, create a file called `.env` inside the `/backend/app/config` folder and paste your API key like so:
   
   ```shell
   OPENAI_KEY=si-IAx6f6cWlgqJ69RVwFKxT3BlbkFJI15IMe23MVM6GVLgjuSD
   ```
   
   ```
   - medium-ai
   -- frontend
   -- backend
   --- app
   ---- config
   ----- .env
   ```

2. Next, it's preferable to install an anaconda virtual environment. You can install the anaconda distribution from [here]([Installing on Windows &#8212; Anaconda documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/)). After installation, you can create a new virtual environment like so:
   
   ```
   conda create -n medium-ai python==3.9 anaconda
   ```
   
   After the virtual environment has been created, you can activate it using the following command:
   
   ```shell
   conda activate medium-ai
   ```

3. Next, you need to access the `backend` folder and install the requirements using the following command:
   
   ```
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. To start the server, run the following command:
   
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
   
   make sure you're inside the `backend` folder before running the command. This will start a server running at port `8080`.

5. Next, refresh your browser and the frontend will automatically pick up the saved data (if any) stored at `backend/app/data`
   
   

## End Notes

If you're looking for a template-free, open-source, AI-powered text editor, medium-ai is the right choice.

However, it is still in its early days and has some unnoticed bugs. I will keep on improving it with time. If you find any bugs or have any suggestions, please raise an issue. Also, if you want to contribute to the project, please check out the GitHub repository.

**Note**: It's important to take backup of your articles frequently and store it elsewhere just in case something goes wrong.
