Summary of changes:

1. Backend Configuration:
    * Modified backend/app/config/config_files.py to use environment variables for OPENAI_API_KEY, OPENAI_BASE_URL, and OPENAI_MODEL.
    * Added default values for OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_MODEL.

2. Backend Services:
    * Modified backend/app/services/ai_autocomplete.py and backend/app/services/ai_edit.py to use the new OpenAIConfig class and environment variables.
    * Removed hardcoded model names and API base URLs.

3. Docker Support:
    * Created backend/Dockerfile to build the backend image.
    * Created frontend/Dockerfile to build the frontend image.
    * Created docker-compose.yml to orchestrate both backend and frontend services.
    * Added a "Docker Installation" section to README.md with instructions for running the application using Docker Compose.

4. Environment Variables:
    * Created a .env file in the root directory to set OPENAI_BASE_URL and OPENAI_MODEL.

Recent changes made to fix AI autocomplete functionality:

1. Updated ai_autocomplete.py to use new OpenAI API syntax (v1.0.0+):
   - Changed from openai.Completion.create() to client.completions.create()
   - Updated OpenAI client initialization to use OpenAI() constructor

2. Modified Dockerfile to run Uvicorn in debug mode:
   - Changed CMD to use --reload flag for better debugging
   - Now using uvicorn directly instead of python main.py

These changes should resolve the autocomplete functionality issues while maintaining compatibility with the latest OpenAI API version.

Appended work:

The following changes were made to `backend/app/services/ai_autocomplete.py` to fix the AI autocomplete functionality:

*   Modified the `fetch_autocomplete_response` function to use the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable for the `model_name` when calling `openai.Completion.create`, ensuring the model specified in the `.env` file is used for the actual API call.
*   Ensured that the `num_tokens_from_string` function within `fetch_autocomplete_response` continues to use "text-curie-001" for token estimation using `tiktoken`.

Additional changes to fix AI autocomplete API server connection:

1. Updated OpenAI client initialization:
   * Changed from old openai.Completion.create() to client.chat.completions.create()
   * Properly initialized OpenAI client with base_url from config
   * Added error handling and logging for API requests

2. Enhanced environment variable handling:
   * Removed default values from Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
   * Added validation in OpenAIConfig to ensure required variables are set
   * Added detailed logging of environment variable loading

3. Configuration improvements:
   * Added startup validation to catch missing environment variables early
   * Added logging throughout the request flow for better debugging
   * Removed token count threshold to ensure API calls are attempted

4. Code structure changes:
   * Updated to use chat completions API consistently
   * Added proper error handling and logging
   * Improved request formatting for chat completions

These changes ensure that:
* The backend properly uses the configured API server (http://192.168.1.57:8080/)
* The correct model (qwen2.5-Coder-14B) is used for API calls
* Environment variables from .env take precedence over any defaults
* Token estimation still uses text-curie-001 for compatibility
